There is a great product-market fit. I like the experience and passion the founder brings to the table. The solution itself is not unique or defensible on tech, there are similar players in the US and Europe. But Waitrr has early traction in the market and there are huge opportunities in APAC if they can move early and scale up fast. Founder needs to bring in senior talent in technology, marketing and analytics who can help drive consumer behaviour changes, find opportunities to monetise consumer insights data on both micro and macro level and figure out if how can they grow their value for partners and users. Take Opentable for example. It started out as a reservation platform and today the system is a fixture in restaurants and its services have grown to include reviews, rewards, recommendations, and (most recently) payments. As I said, this is not a deep tech space,  they key to success is a good product, quick scale up and building differentiation to stave of competition. If they stay focussed on the problem - how can I help restaurant businesses be more successful, I think that is they key. Highly RECOMMEND taking a good look at this startup. There is potential with the right team in place.",2018-01-25 00:50:14,2018-01-25 02:07:24,118398a4bd

Ayoslide hasn't been affected since its an app purely for lock screen ads that has users' permission to display. But this is a slightly grey area and high risk. Possibly their entire business model could get wiped out by one decision by Google. Again, strong competition from other lock screen apps and phone makers like Samsung who are preinstalling lock screen apps in some of their phones to subsidise their buyers.

However the entry barriers are low too. There are CRM modules available in open source that its easy to pick it up, customise, add security and support and add price to it. GetFly does have an early mover advantage over local players and price advantage over global players. They need to figure out what is it that will keep them competitive in this market.
